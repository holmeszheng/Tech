Kubernetes cluster diagram:

(1) master
	# deployment: the app stack

(2) node:
	# kubelet : like docker daemon
	# docker runtime
	# pods: each pod has an unique internal ip address across the cluster
		## containers: exposed port
		## volumes
		(all containers in the same pod share volumes and ip address and port)
