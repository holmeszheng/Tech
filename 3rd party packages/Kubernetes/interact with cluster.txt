# configure kubectl to access kubenetes cluster
In order for kubectl to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a kubeconfig file, which is created automatically when you create a cluster using kube-up.sh or successfully deploy a Minikube cluster. By default, kubectl configuration is located at ~/.kube/config.

Check that kubectl is properly configured by getting the cluster state:

kubectl cluster-info

# cluster context
In ~/.kube/config, more than one cluster context could be configured like the kubectl context called “minikube”.

To let kubectl connect to minikube cluster, run:
kubectl config use-context minikube

Or pass the context on each command like this: kubectl get pods --context=minikube
