#add current user to docker group, so no need to add sudo before every docker command

Create the docker group.
$ sudo groupadd docker

Add your user to the docker group.
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.

$ docker images

#show running containers:

docker run [imageName]

#docker service startup control
Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart.

systemd
enable docker at startup
$ sudo systemctl enable docker

To disable this behavior, use disable instead.
$ sudo systemctl disable docker
