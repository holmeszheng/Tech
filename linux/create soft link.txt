What is Soft Link And Hard Link In Linux?
A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file. But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. If you delete the original file, the hard link can still has the data of the original file. Because hard link acts as a mirror copy of the original file.

In a nutshell, a soft link

can cross the file system,
allows you to link between directories,
has different inodes number and file permissions than original file,
permissions will not be updated,
has only the path of the original file, not the contents.
A hard Link

can’t cross the file system boundaries,
can’t link directories,
has the same inodes number and permissions of original file,
permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,
has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.
