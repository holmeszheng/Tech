(1) locate "exactFileName"
(2) find position [options] pattern
	eg: find . -name "java*"

(3) grep [options] pattern files
		Text search tool in text files in linux

(4) which javac
	find where this command is from
(5) echo $PATH
(6) export $PATH=$PATH:/usr/java-11.0.1/bin
		like define
	echo $Java_HOME will show defined $variables 
(7) aliases could be added into .bashrc like
	alias la='ls -A'
	alias ll='ls -alF'
	alias ls='ls --color=auto'
	
	alias will also show all the aliases in current environment.
	
(8) go to /etc/apt/sources.list.d to check all ppa added.

(9) go to /etc/environment to add network proxy. They way through GUI not reliable.
	This is the system network proxy setting which will be retrieved in multiple places like
		a. in smartgit auto-detect system proxy
		b. in eclipse, native network proxy configuration
(10)
	顺序执行多条命令：command1;command2;command3;
		简单的顺序指令可以通过 ;来实现
	有条件的执行多条命令：which command1 && command2 || command3
		&& : 如果前一条命令执行成功则执行下一条命令，如果command1执行成功（返回0）,则执行command2
		|| :与&&命令相反，执行不成功时执行这个命令
	$?: 存储上一次命令的返回结果
		echo $?
	| piping symbol 管道命令必须要能够接受来自前一个命令的数据成为standard input继续处理才行。
		ls -al /etc | less
		more .bashrc | grep 'eclipse'
		
(11) more, less, cat.
	cat will dump all content of the file into the terminal
	more will dump into terminal but to fit the screen size
	less will have it detached.
	
	enter : next line
	space : page down
	page up
	
(12) touch
		modify the timestamp of a file. Create one if it doesn't exist.
	echo "hello world" >> newfile.txt
		append the standard out into a (new/ existing) file
	viem / gedit ... newfile.txt and save.
	
(13)
	jobs
		show current running jobs
	ps [options]
		show process
	kill [signal] pid
	fg move
		a job to foreground
	bg move
		a job to background and keep running
	Ctrl + z
		stop current process
	gedit &
		run a command in background
