The second context is when a reference is bound to a temporary. 
The temporary to which the reference is
bound or the temporary that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound persists
for the lifetime of the reference except:
― A temporary bound to a reference member in a constructor’s ctor-initializer (12.6.2) persists until the
constructor exits.
― A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call (5.2.2) persists until the completion of
the full-expression containing the call.
― The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function return statement (6.6.3) is not
extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the return statement.
― A temporary bound to a reference in a new-initializer (5.3.4) persists until the completion of the
full-expression containing the new-initializer.
 
能够绑定右值的有const & 和右值引用（&&）两种方式。
（1）一般来说，temporary的lifetime延长到与绑定到的reference的lifetime相同。
